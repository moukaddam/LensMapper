# LensMapper
- A set of classes to handle the experimental data of measured magnetic field 
and simulated magnetic field (using comsol) and produce usefeul graph for 
comparaison. The project also contains a routine to minimise the chi2 
to determine the magnetization of the permanent magnets used in the SPICE lenses 

- input, 2 ascii files with a strict format: 
	+ measured data 
	+ simulated magnetic field

- outout, a root file with a list of graphs and histograms determined by the user
